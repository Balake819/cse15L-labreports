**Terminal Commands:**
We learned to use cd, cat, ls, and pwd. <br/>
<br/>
## cd changes the directory that you are in, taking an input of the file destination that you want to go to.
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$
```
* Without an input, cd by default will revert back to the original directory, in this case being ~.
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ 
```
* With a directory input, the command will take you to that directory, in this case being lecture1.
